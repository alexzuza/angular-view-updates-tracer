It is possible to choose between component namespaces determined by prefix (for example `app` - application components, `mat` - Angular Material components, etc.) or particular components.


There are few options you can choose: class name or selector and label position.

It is possible to filter by component name.
Number in parentheses after component name show instances count of given component.
